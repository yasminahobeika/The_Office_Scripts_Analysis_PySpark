06x19 - St. Patrick's Day
Michael
Michael: Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something[/b]: Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Don't worry, be happy."
