03x22 - Women's Appreciation
Michael
Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the t*rrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
