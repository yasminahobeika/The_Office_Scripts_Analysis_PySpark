Oscar
Oscar: Every few weeks we have the same conversation. "Oscar" "Yeah?" "Can I pawn off stuff from the office and sell it on eBay?" "Umm no, Kevin, you can't." "Can I say I was an astronaut and sell the movie rights?" What do you think Kevin? "Can I sell time shares of my garage?" "Can I rent out my mom's car when she's in Florida?" "Can I be the heir of uh ...and and inherit lots of money?" What is he talking about?
