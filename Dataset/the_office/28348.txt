05x24 - Heavy Competition
Michael
Michael: I wanted to start a company, not a w*r. Because in a w*r, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil w*r is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, w*r was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
