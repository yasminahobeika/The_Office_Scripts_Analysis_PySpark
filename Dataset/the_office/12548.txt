03x10/11 - A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2)
Dwight
Dwight: Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the kn*fe below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of bl*od. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the bl*od... and the innards... and the feathers.
