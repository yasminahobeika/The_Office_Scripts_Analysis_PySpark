05x04 - Baby Shower
Michael
Michael: I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no w*r. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
