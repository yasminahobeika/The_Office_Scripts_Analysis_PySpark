04x11 - Survivor Man
Michael
Michael: This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial k*ll. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
