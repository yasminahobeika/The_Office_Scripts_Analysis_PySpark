05x09 - Frame Toby
Michael
Michael: I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the m*rder comes back and starts k*ll off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
