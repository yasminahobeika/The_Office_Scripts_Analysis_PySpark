Andy: Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs] I graduated in four years. I never stud*ed once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble."
