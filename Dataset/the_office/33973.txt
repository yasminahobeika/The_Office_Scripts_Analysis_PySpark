06x13 - Secret Santa
Erin
Erin: Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat k*ll a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
