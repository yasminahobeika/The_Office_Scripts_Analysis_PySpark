08x08 - Gettysburg
Amanda
Amanda:[on film] You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers â€“ these kind of men preferred peace to w*r. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of w*r this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive... and well... fabulous.
