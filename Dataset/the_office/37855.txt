Dwight: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a t*rror1st. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and p*rn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
