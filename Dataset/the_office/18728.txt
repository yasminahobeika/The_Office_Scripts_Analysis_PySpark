Dwight
Dwight: I keep various w*apon strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep w*apon in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."
