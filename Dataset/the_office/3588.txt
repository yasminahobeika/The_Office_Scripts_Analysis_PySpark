02x06 - The Fight
Dwight
Dwight: I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World w*r II veteran. k*ll 20 men then spent the rest of the w*r in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled bl*od pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
