Michael: Time to bring out the big g*n. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a k*ll joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just k*ll. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
