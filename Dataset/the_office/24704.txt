Michael: [wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be.

And three, [camera zooms out to see fake bl*od is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake bl*od on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
