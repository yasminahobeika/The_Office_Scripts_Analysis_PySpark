07x22 - Goodbye, Michael
Michael
Michael: No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a tr*nsv*stite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
