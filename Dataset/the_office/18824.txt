Michael
Michael: [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A kn*fe, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really b*at down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with kn*fe] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
