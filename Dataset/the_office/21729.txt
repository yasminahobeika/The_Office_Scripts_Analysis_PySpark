04x99 - Deleted Scenes from Season 4
Dwight
Dwight: Will you please? Make a sandwich. Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman. Well, so do I. And so does our secret benefactor. That's too much peanut butter. What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help. If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the kn*fe off before you stick it in the jelly. Have you ever made a sandwich before? Dammit, Meredith!
