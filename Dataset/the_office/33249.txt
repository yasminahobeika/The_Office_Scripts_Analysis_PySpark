Voice on CD player: August the 5th, 1955. It's a sad day down here in Savannah. Local magnate Bill Bourbon was k*ll last night and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal to celebrate Bill as he passes on to his great reward. You're not just here to pay your respects, you have to figure out which of y'all is the no-count scoundrel who k*ll him.
